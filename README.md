## rust-lean-models

Lean models of various Rust libraries to facilitate Lean-based verification of Rust programs.


## Description
The library defines equivalent Lean versions of functions from the Rust standard library.
This library is intended to be used for verifying Rust programs via Lean.

The Lean implementation is based on the description of the Rust functions, which are published at https://doc.rust-lang.org/std.
The library includes:
- Definitions of functions equivalent to those from the Rust standard library
- Proofs that these definitions are consistent with the description of the Rust functions
- Supporting lemmas and theorems for proof construction

## Installation

-  Add the following lines to your `lakefile.lean`:

    ` require «rust-lean-models» from git "https://github.com/model-checking/rust-lean-models" `

- Change the lean version in your `lean-toolchain` to the one in 
[lean-toolchain](https://github.com/model-checking/rust-lean-models/blob/main/lean-toolchain)

- Run `lake update` in the terminal.

- Import the packages and open the namespaces in your Lean files 
(see [ProofTutorial.lean](https://github.com/model-checking/rust-lean-models/tree/main/RustLeanModels/ProofTutorial.lean))

    ```lean
    import RustLeanModels.Basic
    import RustLeanModels.RustString
    open RustString
    open Iterator
    ```

## Usage
### Translating a Rust program 

For any Rust built-in functions which are used in user code, map it with 
the corresponding function name in the library (see the Tables below).

### Proof Tutorial
We demonstrate the applications of the library and some proof techniques 
for String programs in 
[ProofTutorial.lean](https://github.com/model-checking/rust-lean-models/tree/main/RustLeanModels/ProofTutorial.lean)
through two simple programs that compute the longest common prefix 
and longest common substring of the two input strings. 
More examples can be found in 
[ProofExample.lean](https://github.com/model-checking/rust-lean-models/tree/main/RustLeanModels/ProofExample.lean).

## Implementation


### Recursive function definition
For each Rust function, we provide a recursive Lean function. Implementing 
the equivalent functions in Lean recursively enables user to construct 
induction proofs conveniently. The Lean function has the same name as the Rust original, 
except when the Rust name clashes with a Lean keyword. In case of a clash, a Rust function 'func_name' 
is renamed to `rust_func_name` in Lean.

Implementing a function recursively may requires some extra parameters.
In those cases, first, we implement an auxiliary function (name: `func_name_aux`) which is defined 
recursively with the parameters, then we define the function `func_name` based on the auxiliary function 
with initial values for the parameters. 
For example, `char_indices` is defined based on `char_indices_aux` as 
`def char_indices (s: Str) := char_indices_aux s 0`.

For Rust functions involving the `Pattern` type, we implement two recursive sub-functions 
(name: `func_name_char_filter` and  `func_name_substring`) which replace the `Pattern` type 
in the input by either a char filter (or type`Char → Bool`) or a `List Char`. Then we define 
the function `func_name` based on these two sub-functions by matching the input of `Pattern` type.
For example, `split` is defined by two sub-functions `split_char_filter` and `split_substring` as: 

```lean
def split (s: Str) (p: Pattern) := match p with
| Pattern.SingleChar c => split_char_filter s (fun x => x = c)
| Pattern.ListChar l => split_char_filter s (fun x => x ∈ l)
| Pattern.FilterFunction f => split_char_filter s f
| Pattern.WholeString s1 => split_substring s s1
```
All recursive implementations are proven to be "correct" in the sense that 
they are consistent with the descriptions of the Rust versions (see below for more details).

## Correctness Proofs

### For functions that return `Bool` or can be defined based on other functions that have already been proven correct
   
- First, we provide a variant Lean definition of the Rust function that we call the definitional 
version (with name `func_name_def`).  This version is intended to match the documented description 
of the Rust function. Ideally, the definitional version should not contain recursion, except in some trivial cases, 
but it can make use of the recursive versions of other functions that have been previously proven correct.

- Then, we state and prove a theorem that shows that the recursive and definitional versions of Rust 
function `func_name` are equivalent. This equivalence theorem is called `func_name_EQ` and 
it has type `func_name = func_name_def`.
The theorem ensures that the function is implemented correctly 
and allows the two versions to be used interchangeably. 
In some cases, constructing a non-induction proof using the definitional version is more convenient.

- For example, the function `is_char_boundary` has a definitional version: 

    ```lean
    def is_char_boundary_def (s: Str) (i: Nat) := i ∈ ListCharPos s ∨  i = byteSize s
    ```

    a recursive definition:

    ```lean
    def is_char_boundary (s: Str) (i: Nat) := match s with
    | [] => i == 0
    | h::t => if i = 0 then true else
        if i < Char.utf8Size h then false else is_char_boundary t (i - Char.utf8Size h)
    ```


    and an equivalence theorem 
    
    ```lean
    theorem is_char_boundary_EQ : is_char_boundary s p =  is_char_boundary_def s p
    ```

When the description of a Rust function cannot be efficiently expressed in Lean (requires recursions, or is unintuitive),
we can:
- Define the definitional version (similar to Case 1) based on a recursive trivial function, then prove the equivalence theorem.
For example, the `byteSize_def` function is defined on the simple function `sum_list_Nat`
that computes the sum of a list of natural numbers:
    
    ```lean
    def sum_list_Nat (l : List Nat) := List.foldl Nat.add 0 l`
    def byteSize_def (s : List Char) : Nat := sum_list_Nat (List.map (fun x: Char => Char.utf8Size x) s)
    ```

- Define and prove the correctness of one/some subordinate function(s), 
then define the definitional version based on them. 
    For example, to define `split_inclusive_char_filter_def`, firstly we define and prove the coreectness of two functions:
    - `list_char_filter_charIndex (s: Str) (f: Char → Bool)`: returns the list of positions of characters in `s` satisfying the filter `f`

    - `split_at_charIndex_list (s: Str) (l: List Nat)`: split the strings `s` at positions in `l`

    then define `split_inclusive_char_filter_def` based on them:

    ```lean
    def split_inclusive_char_filter_def (s: Str) (f: Char → Bool):= split_at_charIndex_list s (List.map (fun x => x+1) (list_char_filter_charIndex s f))
    ```

### When the Rust documentation describes properties of the return value 
We state and prove a soundness theorem for the function with
name: `func_name_sound` and type: `x = func_name input1 input2 ...  ↔ properties of x`.
For example, the soundness theorem for the function `floor_char_boundary` defined as:

```lean
def floor_char_boundary_aux (s: Str) (i: Nat) (k: Nat): Nat := match s with
  | [] => k
  | h::t => if i < Char.utf8Size h then k else floor_char_boundary_aux t (i - Char.utf8Size h) (k + Char.utf8Size h)

def floor_char_boundary (s: Str) (i: Nat) := floor_char_boundary_aux s i 0
```

is

```lean
theorem floor_char_boundary_sound:  flp = floor_char_boundary s p
      ↔ (is_char_boundary s flp) ∧ (flp ≤ p) ∧ (∀ k, ((is_char_boundary s k) ∧ (k ≤ p)) → k ≤ flp )
```

- The soundness theorem should cover all the properties in the Rust documentation.
- We make some minor/trivial adjustments when needed to express the properties in Lean.
- The modus ponens (→) direction of the theorem is enough to ensure the correctness of the recursive version
if the properties in the right-hand-side ensure that the function in the left-hand-side is deterministic.
- The modus ponens reverse (←) direction ensures that we stated enough properties in right-hand-side such that 
it can be satisfied by only one function. 
- If the function returns an option, we separately state and prove two soundness theorems for the two cases 
of the return value: `func_name_none_sound` and `func_name_some_sound`. For example:
    
    ```lean
    theorem split_at_none_sound : split_at s p = none ↔ ¬ ∃ s1, List.IsPrefix s1 s ∧ byteSize s1 = p
    theorem split_at_some_sound : split_at s p = some (s1, s2) ↔ byteSize s1 = p ∧ s = s1 ++ s2
    ```

- For functions involving the `Pattern` type,  we separately state and prove two equivalent/soundness 
theorems for the two sub-functions discussed previously (`func_name_char_filter_EQ` and `func_name_substring_EQ`) 
or (`func_name_char_filter_sound` and `func_name_substring_sound`). For example:
    
    ```lean
    theorem contains_char_filter_EQ : contains_char_filter s f  = contains_char_filter_def s f
    theorem contains_substring_EQ : contains_substring s p  = contains_substring_def s p
    ```
